the adv of link n ellie

what I'm trying to ultimately accomplish:

-create a game
-use CRUD to create new players (reference 80s games to see how I feel)
  -edit players by way of updating their stats when they level up or save
  -delete players if they want to start over or delete their character
  -make it password protected so someone else can't delete your character
-make the game an turn based RPG
-have a battle system that uses simulated dice to conduct battles
  -user str vs enemy def = -hp (obviously other things will play into it)
  -user def vs enemy str = -hp to player
-db.json for now will house all of the base stats and updated stats
-import custom pics and drawings
-import music and sounds
-pics and sounds save for if I get this done before the deadline
-have vendors that sell items(save for later)
-have enemies have a small chance of things they can drop(save for later maybe)
-have enemies have an item that can be stolen(later?)
