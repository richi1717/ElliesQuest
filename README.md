<h2>Ellie's Quest</h2>
This is a turn based RPG similar to Final Fantasy games from the 90s and 80s.  I did this for my final 
project at Rockit Bootcamp and had just two weeks to complete this project.  I did borrow images, music, 
and sound from various Final Fantasy games just because of my time constraints.  I would like to create
all of my sprites, sounds, and music from scratch.  

<h2>Bugs</h2>
There are some issues with using Backbone history that will cause some bugs.  This can be fixed by
refreshing the browser.  I plan on fixing these bugs at a later date but am now focused on learning other frameworks.  There is a lot that needs to be done in this game and one huge issue is making it fit on different screens.  I used a 13" MacBook Pro to design it so if you're using something else and there is a gap in between the bottom sections of the battle screen or if they are overlapping, try zooming in or out with cmd + '+' or cmd + '-' or ctrl + '+' or ctrl + '-' if you are unfortunate to have to use Windows:( 

<h2>Want to Play My Game or Just Mess With My Code?</h2>
Just clone this repo if you want to check out or try my game.  Next, in 
terminal ```$ npm i``` will install all of the dependencies that are needed to run my game.  Then
in terminal still ```$ gulp``` will actually build the program and then serve it on http://localhost:8000/. 
I programmed it to work with a controller if you install a plugin like <a href="https://yukkurigames.com/enjoyable/">enjoyable</a>.  If no controller
is desired I also list the controls on my homepage under controls.  If anyone has any questions, job offers,
advice, or just wants to talk, my email is richi1717@gmail.com.
