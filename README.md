# ElliesQuest

This is a turn based RPG similar to Final Fantasy games from the 90s and 80s.  I did this for my final 
project at Rockit Bootcamp and had just two weeks to complete this project.  I did borrow images, music, 
and sound from various Final Fantasy games just because of my time constraints.  Would like to create
all of my sprites, sounds, and music from scratch.  

There are some issues with using Backbone history that will cause some bugs.  This can be fixed by
refreshing the browser.  I plan on fixing these bugs at a later date but am now focused on getting
a job and learning other frameworks.  

Just fork and clone this repo if you want to check out or try my game or just clone it.  Next, in 
terminal $npm install will install all of the dependencies that are needed to run my game.  Then
in terminal still $gulp will actually build the program and then serve it on http://localhost:8000/. 
I programmed it to work with a controller if you install a plugin like enjoyable.  If no controller
is desired I also list the controls on my homepage under controls.  If anyone has any questions, job offers,
advice, or just wants to talk, my email is richi1717@gmail.com.
